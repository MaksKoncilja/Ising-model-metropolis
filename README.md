# Ising-model-metropolis
Metropolis algorithm applied to 2d Ising model, criticality and finite size effects, code for .gif of a lattice thermalisation and Hoshen Kopelman algorithm

The repository consists of 4 files:
- a .pdf file called Using Monte Carlo Methods on the Ising Model (where you can learn the basics of the Metropolis algorithm through a practical example of the Ising model.)
- metropolis.ipynb python code with metropolis algorithm, graphs of average magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, two cumulants and critical exponents
- Hoshen_Kopelman_algorithm.ipynb paython code with Hoshen Kopelman algorithm with a graph log(P(S)) as a function of log(S)
- gif_crtitical_T.ipynb python code for creating .gif of termalisation process of a lattice at critical temperature
